PyDESeq2 is a python implementation of the [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)
method [1] for differential expression analysis (DEA) with bulk RNA-seq data, originally in R.
It aims to facilitate DEA experiments for python users.

As PyDESeq2 is a re-implementation of [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) from
scratch, you may experience some differences in terms of retrieved values or available features.

Currently, available features broadly correspond to the default settings of DESeq2 (v1.34.0) for single-factor and
multi-factor analysis (with categorical or continuous factors) using Wald tests.
We plan to implement more in the future.
In case there is a feature you would particularly like to be implemented, feel free to open an issue.

## Installation

### PyPI

`PyDESeq2` can be installed from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pydeseq2
```

We recommend installing within a conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n pydeseq2
conda activate pydeseq2
conda install pip
pip install pydeseq2
```

You can also add it to your projects through `uv`:

```bash
uv add pydeseq2
```

### Bioconda

`PyDESeq2` can also be installed from Bioconda with `conda`:

`conda install -c bioconda pydeseq2`

If you're interested in contributing or want access to the development version, please see the [contributing](#contributing) section.

### Requirements

The list of package version requirements is available in `pyproject.toml`.

For reference, the code is being tested in a github workflow (CI) with python
3.11 to 3.13 and the latest versions of the following packages:

```
- anndata
- formulaic
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- formulaic-contrasts
- matplotlib
```

Please don't hesitate to open an issue in case you encounter any issue due to possible deprecations.


## Getting started

The [Getting Started](https://pydeseq2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/index.html) section of the documentation
contains downloadable examples on how to use PyDESeq2.

### Transcript-length normalization

For unscaled estimated gene counts imported from transcript-level quantifiers
(`countsFromAbundance="no"` in tximport), pass the matching average transcript lengths
alongside the counts. Both matrices must use samples as rows and genes as columns. When
using data frames, their labels and ordering must be identical; arrays must already use
the same ordering:

```python
dds = DeseqDataSet(
    counts=estimated_counts,
    metadata=metadata,
    transcript_lengths=average_transcript_lengths,
    design="~condition",
)
dds.deseq2()
```

[`pytximport`](https://github.com/complextissue/pytximport), described in [4], can
produce a compatible AnnData object directly:

```python
from pydeseq2.dds import DeseqDataSet
from pytximport import tximport

sample_names = ["sample_1", "sample_2"]
txi = tximport(
    [f"{sample}/quant.sf" for sample in sample_names],
    data_type="salmon",
    transcript_gene_map=transcript_gene_map,
    counts_from_abundance=None,
    output_type="anndata",
)
txi.obs = metadata.loc[sample_names].copy()
dds = DeseqDataSet(adata=txi, design="~condition")
dds.deseq2()
```

Use only unscaled estimated counts (`counts_from_abundance=None`); the file list and
metadata rows must use the same sample order. For backed AnnData, call
`adata.to_memory()` first and ensure sufficient memory. Length-source precedence is
deterministic: explicit `transcript_lengths`, `adata.layers["avg_tx_length"]`, then
compatible pytximport fields; PyDESeq2 copies `adata.obsm["length"]` into the canonical
layer. Because that matrix has no gene labels and AnnData does not align its second
`obsm` dimension with `adata.var`, pass it before gene-axis subsetting/reordering or
apply the same selection and order to `adata.obsm["length"]`.

Following the
[`tximport`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html) and
[`DESeq2`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)
workflow [1, 3], PyDESeq2 rounds estimated counts and combines transcript-length
offsets with median-of-ratios library-size normalization. Average lengths and the
resulting sample-by-gene factors are available in `dds.layers["avg_tx_length"]`
and `dds.layers["normalization_factors"]`. The `ratio` and `poscounts`
size-factor methods are supported; `iterative` is not currently compatible with
transcript-length offsets.


### Documentation

The documentation is hosted [here on ReadTheDocs](https://pydeseq2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
If you want to have the latest version of the documentation, you can build it from source.
Please go to the dedicated [README.md](https://github.com/owkin/PyDESeq2/blob/main/docs/README.md) for information on how to do so.

### Data

The quick start examples use synthetic data, provided in this repo (see [datasets](https://github.com/owkin/PyDESeq2/blob/main/datasets/README.md).)

The experiments described in the [PyDESeq2 article](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/9/btad547/7260507) rely on data
from [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga),
which may be obtained from this [portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/).

## Contributing

Please the [Contributing](https://pydeseq2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/contributing.html) section of the
documentation to see how you can contribute to PyDESeq2.

### 1 - Download the repository

`git clone https://github.com/owkin/PyDESeq2.git`

### 2 - Create a uv environment

Run `uv venv --python 3.13` (or higher python version) to create the `pydeseq2` environment and then activate it:
`source .venv/bin/activate`.

`cd` to the root of the repo and run `uv sync --extra dev --extra doc` to install in developer mode.

Then, run `pre-commit install`.

The `pre-commit` tool will automatically run [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

PyDESeq2 is a living project and any contributions are welcome! Feel free to open new PRs or issues.
