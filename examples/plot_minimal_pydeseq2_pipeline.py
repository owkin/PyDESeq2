"""
PyDESeq 2 pipeline
===========================

This notebook gives a minimalistic example of how to perform DEA using PyDESeq2.

It allows you to run the PyDESeq2 pipeline either on synthetic data or on one of
the following TCGA datasets:

- TCGA-BRCA
- TCGA-COAD
- TCGA-LUAD
- TCGA-LUSC
- TCGA-PAAD
- TCGA-PRAD
- TCGA-READ
- TCGA-SKCM.

While the synthetic data is part of this repository, TCGA data should be
downloaded as per the instructions in `datasets/`.

Running this pipeline may take a few minutes (~5-10 min for TCGA) depending on
your setup and on the chosen dataset.

# ------------------------------------------------------
#
# We start by creating a `DeseqDataSet` object with the count and clinical data.
# Here, we use 8 threads, feel free to adapt this to your setup or to set
# to `None` to use all available CPUs.
#
# Another option of interest is the `refit_cooks` argument
# (set to `True` by default), which controls whether Cooks outlier
# should be refitted â€“ this is advised, in general.
#
# .. note::
#  in the case of the provided synthetic data, there won't be any Cooks
#  outliers.

# 2 - Statistical analysis with the `DeseqStats` class
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# The `DeseqDataSet` class has a unique mandatory arguments, `dds`, which should
# be a *fitted* `DeseqDataSet` object, as well as a set of optional keyword
# arguments, among which:
#
# - `alpha`: the p-value and adjusted p-value significance threshold (0.05 by default),
# - `cooks_filter`: whether to filter p-values based on cooks outliers (True by default),
# - `independent_filter`: whether to perform independent filtering to correct
#   p-value trends (True by default).
#

# Wald test

#
# The `summary` function runs the statistical analysis (multiple testing
# adjustement included) and returns a summary DataFrame.

# For visualization or post-processing purposes, it might be suitable to perform
# LFC shrinkage. This is implemented by the `lfc_shrink` method.
