Getting started
===============

Pydeseq2 pipeline:
This notebook gives a minimalistic example of how to perform DEA using PyDESeq2.

It allows you to run the PyDESeq2 pipeline on synthetic data provided as part of
this repository.

# 1 - Read counts modeling with the `DeseqDataSet` class
# ------------------------------------------------------
#
# We start by creating a `DeseqDataSet` object with the count and clinical data.
# Here, we use 8 threads, feel free to adapt this to your setup or to set
# to `None` to use all available CPUs.
#
# Another option of interest is the `refit_cooks` argument
# (set to `True` by default), which controls whether Cooks outlier
# should be refitted â€“ this is advised, in general.
#
# .. note::
#  in the case of the provided synthetic data, there won't be any Cooks
#  outliers.
#
# Start by creating a DeseqDataSet
#
# .. note::
#   "condition" is a column in `clinical_df`. You might need to update it if you
#   use different dataset.

# 2 - Statistical analysis with the `DeseqStats` class
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# The `DeseqDataSet` class has a unique mandatory arguments, `dds`, which should
# be a *fitted* `DeseqDataSet` object, as well as a set of optional keyword
# arguments, among which:
#
# - `alpha`: the p-value and adjusted p-value significance threshold (0.05 by default),
# - `cooks_filter`: whether to filter p-values based on cooks outliers (True by default),
# - `independent_filter`: whether to perform independent filtering to correct
#   p-value trends (True by default).
#

# Wald test
# ^^^^^^^^^
#
# The `summary` function runs the statistical analysis (multiple testing
# adjustement included) and returns a summary DataFrame.

# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# For visualization or post-processing purposes, it might be suitable to perform
# LFC shrinkage. This is implemented by the `lfc_shrink` method.
