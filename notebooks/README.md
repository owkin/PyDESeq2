# Notebooks

This folder contains examples of DEA pipelines with PyDESeq2. They rely on the synthetic data stored in the [`datasets`](../datasets/README.md) directory.

- `PyDESeq2_minimal_example`: a minimal example of a DEA pipeline.
- `PyDESeq2_step_by_step_pipeline`: a more detailed version of the above example, where each step is shown.
