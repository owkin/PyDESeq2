# PyDESeq2

PyDESeq2 is a Python implementation of the [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) method {cite:p}`love2014moderated` for differential expression analysis with bulk RNA-seq data, originally written in R.
It works on {class}`~anndata.AnnData` objects and is part of the [scverse ecosystem](https://scverse.org).

Because PyDESeq2 is a reimplementation from scratch, you may see differences in retrieved values or available features.
Current features broadly correspond to the default settings of DESeq2 (v1.34.0) for single-factor and multi-factor analysis, with categorical or continuous factors, using Wald tests, plus an optional [apeGLM](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/12/2084/5159452) log fold-change shrinkage step {cite:p}`zhu2019heavy`.
If there is a feature you would like to see, open an issue on GitHub.
