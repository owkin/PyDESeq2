PyDESeq2 documentation
======================

This package is a python implementation of the `DESeq2 <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html>`_ method [1]_
for differential expression analysis (DEA) with bulk RNA-seq data, originally in R.
It aims to facilitate DEA experiments for python users.

As PyDESeq2 is a re-implementation of `DESeq2 <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html>`_ from scratch, you may experience some differences in terms of retrieved values or available features.

Currently, available features broadly correspond to the default settings of DESeq2 (v1.34.0) for single-factor analysis, with an optional `apeGLM <https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/12/2084/5159452>`_ LFC shrinkage [2]_.
We plan to implement more in the near future. In case there is a feature you would particularly like to be implemented, feel free to open an issue on GitHub.
