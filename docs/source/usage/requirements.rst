Requirements
------------

The list of package version requirements is available in ``setup.py``, and will be automatically installed along PyDESeq2 when using PyPI.
For reference, the code was tested with python 3.10 and the following package versions::

    - anndata >= 0.8.0
    - formulaic >= 1.0.2  
    - numpy >= 1.23.0
    - pandas >= 1.4.0
    - scikit-learn >= 1.1.0
    - scipy >= 1.11.0
    - formulaic-contrasts >= 0.2.0
    - matplotlib >= 3.6.2

Note that starting from pydeseq2 0.5.0, python 3.9 is no longer supported.
Please don't hesitate to open an issue in case you encounter any problems due to possible deprecations.
